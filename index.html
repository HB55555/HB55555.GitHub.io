                <p>
                    Gelato, Ice Creamâ€™s Italian cousin, is made with whole milk, without using added cream. This makes the milkfat percentage much lower than traditional ice cream. 
					Also, gelato is often made without eggs and stabilizers. While it is being churned, there is little to no air whipped into it, leaving a dense, thick texture.eometry published by Bianchi in 1902.

                    Frozen yogurt, or Fro-Yo, is a very popular form of ice cream right now. This frozen treat is made using some of the same ingredients as ice cream, but with a much lower percentage of fat. 
					There is also yogurt mixed in, which gives it more of a tart taste. it in other areas of mathematics.
